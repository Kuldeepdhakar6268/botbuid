 You acknowledge that TEAM ENERVINE delivers SMS’s via major telecom operators and can therefore only influence the delivery transmission of SMS within the technical constraints imposed. SMS’s submitted via the Internet will be transferred to mobile network providers, provided that the recipient’s phone is switched on and doesn’t have a full memory and is located in an area covered by its subscribed mobile network provider. You acknowledge that, depending on the recipient’s mobile provider service, it may not be possible to transmit the SMS to the recipient successfully.

 </li>
 
 
 <li className='my-2'>
 TEAM ENERVINE doesn’t refund the credits for undeliverable messages to you because we cannot guarantee delivery of the SMS’s to recipients due to possible errors. TEAM ENERVINE debits transmitted SMS’s according to its transmission logs. These logs are deemed correct and valid even if the customer has objected to the correctness of the accounting records, except if an investigation by TEAM ENERVINE has produced evidence of a technical problem or error.

 <li>
 TEAM ENERVINE reserves the right to exclude you from using this service, refunding you any remaining amount in your account. All purchases must be considered final, in compliance with our no-refund policy.

 <p className='my-3 text-[16px]'>Limitations of Liability Disclaimer
 </p>
 
 <p className=' text-sm/7  text-justify'>
 Except for any of our explicit warranties and our obligations, we are offering our Services “as is.”<br/>
  Whilst we will take all reasonable steps to deliver your messages to the recipients as fast as possible, we cannot commit to, or guarantee, a specific delivery time. Such times depend on various network and system-related factors among the various entities involved in the transportation of your messages across the cellular mobile networks.<br/>
  You acknowledge that as we send and receive text-messages via major telecommunication companies and Mobile Network Operators, our influence over the transmission of your messages is within the technical constraints imposed upon us.    <br/>
  Our responsibility is therefore to ensure that the text-messages you send through the service are processed correctly and delivered to the assigned entity. We are not responsible for the final delivery of the message, as this is out of our control and is the responsibility of the Mobile Network Operator.                                                                           <br/>  
  SMS’s that cannot be delivered within the lifespan allocated to them, either by us or a Mobile Network Operator, will be discarded by the Mobile Network Operator, without any notice. We are not liable for any loss incurred by the failure of a message to be delivered and you acknowledge that damages concerning financial or other loss resulting from delivery failure cannot be claimed from Team ENERVINE. Furthermore, you agree that the message contents are deemed to have zero value.                                                                      <br/>  
  You also acknowledge that text-messages are transmitted unencrypted and that eavesdropping of mobile phone communications, including SMS delivery by third parties is possible. We also recommend that you ensure sensitive and valuable information is communicated by a number of superior communication methods.                                                  <br/>
  Furthermore, use of the service and the Internet is at its own risk and that the service is provided “as is” and “as available,” without any warranties or conditions whatsoever, expressed or implied. We will apply all commercially reasonable efforts to make access to the service                                                                <br/>
 <br/>               available through the required access protocols but make no warranty or guarantee that you will be able to access the service at any particular time or any particular location.

 <hr className=' border-black my-7'/>
 
 <p className='my-3 text-[16px]'>Modification of Terms
 </p> 
 <p className=''> Our terms are aligned and subject to modification according to laws and guidelines by local government bodies.
 </p>
 <p className=' text-justify'>We frequently update, modify, and otherwise continually seek to improve the service and such changes often dictate that we simultaneously modify the terms and conditions of use. As such, we have the right to modify the terms of this agreement and to change or discontinue any aspect or feature of our service, in either case, as it deems reasonably necessary. If you do not agree with any such changes, your use of the service may be cancelled in accordance with the procedures for cancellation set forth in this agreement. You acknowledge your responsibility to review this agreement from time to time and to be aware of any such changes and, should you request, we will be happy to keep you informed if/when such changes take place. Furthermore, you accept that should there be a contradiction between other specific terms and conditions and these general terms and conditions, the other specific terms and conditions shall apply</p>
 
 <hr className=' border-black my-7'/>
     
 
 <p className='my-3 text-[16px]'>Termination
 </p>
  <p className='text-justify text-sm/7'>
  Any breach can result in termination. You have equal rights.
  If at any time you breach the terms and conditions of the service, we may elect to suspend, terminate and/or cancel this agreement and/or recover any damages from you arising from the event(s) giving rise to the suspension, termination, or cancellation. We reserve the right to suspend your service at any stage for any reason we may deem necessary to continue to provide any of our services in a way that may be hindered by your status as being our client, your financial status, or the content of the messages originating from you.
  Upon any such termination, cancellation, and/or suspension, you are still responsible for any obligations that have accrued. Payment and other obligations under this agreement are not suspended, stayed, or otherwise affected by a suspension of access to/or use of the service (in whole or in part) where said suspension arises from your failure to comply with, or violation of, the terms of this agreement or of any law or legal obligation. Upon termination and/or cancellation, for any reason, you agree to immediately cease using the service and we shall have no obligation to you after any termination or cancellation of this agreement.
  You are also free to terminate or cancel this agreement at any time, and for any reason. For such termination or cancellation to be effective, however, you must inform us in writing through Email. You will still be under the responsibilities of this agreement for the duration that you used the service and you will cease to have access to the use of any credits that may exist in your account.
